<p>First conceived by third-generation bagel baker Richard Katz, of Chelsea, Massachusetts, pizza bagels have filled the hearts, and stomachs, of millions <b>since
the 1970's.</b> While the original intention of bakers was to sell this item to children, the pizza bagel is now a beloved dish of mature audiences as well. And
with its ingenious design and evergrowing appeal, it's not very hard to see why.</p> 
  

<h2>Portability</h2>
<p>The pizza on its own, has spread has spread far beyond the coast of Italy and the Mediteranean Sea to have global influence. Regardless of where one is in the
world, every time one thinks of pizza they likely picture a jolly chef elegantly spinning dough, spreading ingredients, and cooking to perfection in a
guargantuan oven. The pizza bagel takes this same experience and packages it into a more simple, compact vessel. While the consumption of an enitre full-sized 
pizza by one's self is not a daunting task to some, the pizza bagel offers a delicious alternative. Bagels by nature, have a hand-held quality, meaning they can be
carried and consumed anywhere. Therefore, if one can comfortably finish two pieces of pizza in a single sitting, then certainly eating both halves of a large pizza
bagel would be no chore. Plus, where the average oven could fit one pizza, it could likely fit twenty-times as many pizza bagels. This convenience also means no
need for excessive preparation, or awaiting delivery from an oblong box.</p>
  
  
<h2>Customization</h2>
<p>With the popularity of pizza across the globe, new flavor combinations seemingly arise by the day. As they continue to come to light, these combinations could be
explored even further with the help of the pizza bagel. In its simplest form, the essential elements of a pizza bagel are the grain base, a spreadable element, a
creamy element, and an optional protein elemtent. Pizza utilizes a similar foundation, but the key difference between the two is a variety of bases. Where few
Where few innovations have been made in pizza dough over the years, bagels have popularized many flavors accepted by consumers. This creates a more vast landscape
on which one can explore their individual taste. Moreover, with each pizza bagel traditionally meant for a single consumer, this exploration can be truly individual
with no need to share.
  

<h2>Satifaction to the Palate</h2>
<p>As previously discussed, the pizza bagel allows the consumer a high degree of culinary expolration, and there is a very practical reason why. Pizza is typically
sighted as a lunch and dinner meal. Bagels, meanwhile, are typically sighted as a breakfast and brunch item. Therefore, the pizza bagel seems to blur the line
between all meals. If given 3 plain bagels, one could prepare an apple, fig-jam, creamcheese pizza bagel for breakfast, a classic mozzarella, marinara pizza bagel
for lunch, and a buffalo-chicken, bleu cheese pizza bagel for dinner. So is the pizza bagel a meal that can be enjoyed twenty-four hours a day? Signs point to yes!</p>
